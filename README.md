# MadLib
A simple MadLib Game. First project w/ Python

The main file is MadLib.py. The rest is basically a bunch of functions and the .txt files contain the words and the 2 letters. 
There is GUI so you need to run either natively in Python or via terminal, downloading all the files. 

Hope you like it, and feedbacks are welcome
